# advanced-google-search
A power tool for power users of Google. This website [http://advanced-google-search.rf.gd/](http://advanced-google-search.rf.gd/) that finds you more relevant, personalized, and useful results from Google searches. 

# 30 second pitch
We made this productivity tool for power users who want to find more exact results. This is useful when searching for topics that take on multiple settings, and good for filtering by a specific type of file, phrase, or word. The tool works by using the advanced search operators already built in to Google search; however, we thought memorizing the operators would be difficult, so we decided to spend a whole weekend building this tool! Oh wait...

# The dev stack
Coming off of a tough semester with lots of new languages, algorithms, and frameworks, we decided to stick with good ol' vanilla html, css, and javascript for this project.

# Contributors
We are all Bowdoin college students who study computer science. However, between the four of us, we also have interests in Biology, Education, Theology, History, and Environmental Sustainability.

# Why we built this
We built this for the 2020 Hack the Northest (HTNE) -- a virtual hackathon.

# Ideation
Nearly everyone uses Google to search the web, but there is, in fact, an ["Advanced Search"](https://www.google.com/advanced_search)
for power users. It looks something like:

We wanted to improve on Google's design, and thought it would be an acheivable, yet impactful, project for this hackathon.

# Inspiration 
In addition to the search modification functionality, we also wanted to generate the "Search String" as the user started to list requirements. Because the user can see the Search String being built, it gives them control over their inputs. And, in each text field's default state, inputs are prefilled with suggestions which prompts the user to type inputs in the correct format.

Additionally, placing each module in close proximity with each other appeals to Fitt's Law by reducing the amount of time a user needs to navigate between the different options.

# Implementation
### Our first prototype (complete with the ideas and requirements)

### Second prototype (this time with some *~google~* colors)

### Final prototype (search bar and module locations moved + dark background)

# Overview of iterations
In the interest of time, we used rapid prototyping--we're not kidding...
