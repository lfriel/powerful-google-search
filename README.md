# powerful-google-search
A power tool for power users of Google. This website ([http://advanced-google-search.rf.gd/](http://advanced-google-search.rf.gd/)) helps you find more relevant, personalized, and useful results from your Google searches. 

# 30 second pitch
Finding the correct Google query string is an art in and of itself. We made this productivity tool for those times when you're looking for something specific, but other results keep drowning out what you're looking for. The tool works by using the advanced search operators already built in to Google search. However, for the casual user memorizing these operators can be difficult, so we decided to spend a weekend building this tool! Oh wait... Anyway, if your topic takes on multiple settings, or you're looking for a particular filetype, phrase, or word, this is the tool that is one click away--and it will be there to save the day. Superman's got nothin' on *\~Advanced Google Search\~*!

# The dev stack
Coming off of a tough semester with lots of new languages, algorithms, and frameworks, we decided to stick with good ol' vanilla html, css, and javascript for this project.

# Why we built this
We built this for the 2020 Hack the Northeast (HTNE) -- a virtual hackathon.

# Ideation
Nearly everyone uses Google to search the web, but there is, in fact, an ["Advanced Search"](https://www.google.com/advanced_search)
for power users. It looks something like:

We wanted to improve on Google's design, and thought it would be an achievable, yet impactful, project for this hackathon.

# Inspiration 
In addition to the search modification functionality, we also wanted to generate the "Search String" as the user started to list requirements. Because the user can see the Search String being built, it gives them control over their inputs. And, in each text field's default state, inputs are prefilled with suggestions which prompts the user to type inputs in the correct format.

Additionally, placing each module in close proximity with each other appeals to Fitt's Law by reducing the amount of time a user needs to navigate between the different options.

# Implementation

### Final prototype (search bar and module locations moved + dark background)

# Overview of iterations
In the interest of time, we used rapid prototyping--we're not kidding...
